# jmmm 0.2

## Major changes
Update to the mmm_model() function. It no longer requires the user to specify the parallel back end as an argument. Instead the user should specificy their preferred back end prior to running the function. This way users have more control over parallelization in their specific setting.

## Minor changes
* Added examples to documentation.
* Added versions to package dependencies.
